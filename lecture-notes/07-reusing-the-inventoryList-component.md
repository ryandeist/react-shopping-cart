# React Shopping Cart - Resuing the InventoryList component

## Reusable components
Reusable components are a significant strength in React. A reusable component is a piece of UI that can be reused in various parts of an application. They allow us to create multiple instances of the same UI shell, with the displayed data being determined by `props`.

No special syntax is involved in making a component reusable, but they do require a bit of planning.

### Making components reusable
We'll make our `InventoryList` component reusable in the following steps. 

Currently, the `InventoryList` component displays an `h2` tag reading **Inventory List** alongside a list of items. With a few changes, the `InventoryList` component can be used to display items in the shop's inventory, and items in the user's cart.

For this to work, we'll need to add **two state variables** in `Shop.jsx`.
* `shopInventory`: An array containing the available items in the shop. We'll set its initial state to the imported `inventoryData`, as the shop should start with all available items. 
* `userInventory` An array containing items added to the user's inventory. We'll set its initial state to an empty array. 
> You can remove the existing inventory useState variable. We won't need it anymore. 

After this change and a few changes to props, this will be our new component hierarchy diagram:

From `Shop.jsx`, we can pass each piece of state down to two separate instances of the `InventoryList`. The `InventoryList` component is already designed to map through the `inventory` prop data it receives. We need to update the value associated with this prop so that our multiple instance of `InventoryList` work. We can also provide each `InventoryList` instance with a distinct `title` prop. 

Time to make the adjustments. Let's refactor `Shop.jsx` with the following: 

```jsx
// src/components/Shop/Shop.jsx

// npm modules
import { useState } from 'react';

// components
import InventoryList from '../../components/InventoryList/InventoryList';

// data
import { inventoryData } from '../../data/data';

const Shop = () => {
  // Create state variables for the shop and user inventories.
  const [shopInventory, setShopInventory] = useState(inventoryData);
  const [userInventory, setUserInventory] = useState([]);

  const handleAddItem = () => {
    // We'll refactor this in a bit
  };

  return (
    <main>
      <h1>Shop</h1>
      <section>
        <InventoryList title="Shop Inventory" inventory={shopInventory} />
        <InventoryList title="User Inventory" inventory={userInventory} />
      </section>
    </main>
  );
};

export default Shop;
```

Head back to `InventoryList.jsx`. We need to update the `<h2>` tage to use the `title` prop:

```jsx
// src/components/InventoryList/InventoryList.jsx

const InventoryList = (props) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{props.title}</h2>
      <ul>
        {props.inventory.map((item) => (
          <li key={item._id}>
            <p>{item.name}</p>
            <p>Price: {item.price}</p>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};

export default InventoryList;
```

Check the browser. You should see two lists - one for the shop's inventory and another for the user's inventory. At the moment, only the shop's inventory will include items. The two lists are stacked on top of one another, so you'll need to scroll to the bottom of the page to see the user's inventory. 

## Some quick styling
Now that we have two list components let's add some styling so they're not stacked. CSS classes are generally preferable to inline styles if their values aren't being computed, and they help keep your JSX legible. 

To help keep things organized, let's create a new `Shop.css` file inside our `Shop` component directory. 

```
touch src/components/Shop/Shop.css
```

Next, import `./Shop.css` and apply the class name `shop-section` to the `<section>` tag, 
> We use className instead of class (as class is a reserved word in JavaScript) when applying classes in JSX.

```jsx
// src/components/Shop/Shop.jsx

// npm modules
import { useState } from 'react';

// components
import InventoryList from '../../components/InventoryList/InventoryList';

// data
import { inventoryData } from '../../data/data';

// css
import './Shop.css';

const Shop = () => {
  const [shopInventory, setShopInventory] = useState(inventoryData);
  const [userInventory, setUserInventory] = useState([]);

  const handleAddItem = () => {
    // We'll refactor this in the following steps
  };

  return (
    <main>
      <h1>Shop</h1>
      <section className="shop-section">
        <InventoryList title="Shop Inventory" inventory={shopInventory} />
        <InventoryList title="User Inventory" inventory={userInventory} />
      </section>
    </main>
  );
};

export default Shop;
```

In `Shop.css`, add the following styles:

```css
.shop-section {
  display: flex;
  align-items: flex-start;
  justify-content: center;
  gap: 20px;
}

.shop-section > div {
  min-width: 450px;
}

.shop-section h2 {
  text-align: center;
}
```

Refresh the browser - you should see each list as a distinct column.
